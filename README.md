# Symfony Documentation: Version Selector

SfDVS is a Google Chrome extension which allow to force the Symfony documentation version to use.

## Why ?

I'm a french web developer.

And when I search something about symfony on Google, I always get the french version of the doc, which is not up-to-date.

Furthermore, I'm working on multiple projects. In part on a 2.3 (LTS) project, in part on a 2.6 project.

When I'm working on my 2.3 project, I always want to see the 2.3 documentation.

So I made this extension to always see the documentation in english with a version defined in preferences.

## Usage

1. Go on a Symfony documentation page

2. An icon will appear on the Chrome URL bar

3. Right click on this icon to Enable/Disable the extension and select the version

## Installation

You'll find the extension on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/symfony-documentation-ver/eebbahpmjcfihagocioeclkjmafhdlhk)
