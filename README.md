# Symfony Doc Force Version

## Why ?

1. I'm a french web developer. And when I search something about symfony on Google, I always get the french version of the doc, which is not up-to-date.

2. I'm working on multiple projects. Sometimes on a 2.3 project, and sometimes on a 2.6 project. So when I'm working on my 2.3 project, I configure the extension to get the 2.3 doc.

So I made this extension to always see the documentation in english with a version defined in preferences.

## Usage

1. Go on a Symfony documentation page

2. An icon will appear on the Chrome URL bar

3. Right click on this icon to Enable/Disable the extension and select the version
